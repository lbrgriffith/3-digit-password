# Puzzle Padlock Game
Introduction
"Puzzle Padlock" is a simple yet engaging web-based game where players try to guess a randomly generated 3-digit password within a limited number of attempts. 
The game provides feedback on each guess, informing the player about the number of digits that are correct and whether they are in the correct position. 
It features a hint system that can be used once per game, at the cost of a score penalty.

## Usage
